This is the Crowdsourced CSIRT implementation that runs on ccsirt.labs.doknos.com.

It is free software available under the terms of Perl itself.

It needs ccsirt-backend to be put in /usr/local/bin, the path adjusted on the frontend .module, and the Perl libraries cited in the ccsirt-backend file installed via CPAN.

The backend does checks for phishing. It will include malware checks in the future.

Feel free to reach out to j@bureado.com and Twitter @bureado for questions.
